Build your own marketplace with PHP+SQL

## PHP as local web server

* https://www.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php
* To start coding with PHP, you can use the built-in web server. This is a simple web server that is bundled with PHP. It is designed to be used for development only. It is not recommended to use it in a production environment.

```
.
â””â”€â”€ marketplace
    â”œâ”€â”€ LICENSE
    â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
    â””â”€â”€ public
        â””â”€â”€ index.php
    
# go to the public/ folder
# and start the web server with this command
php -S localhost:9876

OR

php framework.php web 9876

```

* Inside VSCode, you can develop by SSH and use port forwarding to view the web page in your local browser

* Inside VSCode, you can also use the "PHP Server" extension to start the web server

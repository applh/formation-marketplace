Build your own marketplace with PHP+SQL

## PHP as local web server

* https://www.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php
* To start coding with PHP, you can use the built-in web server. This is a simple web server that is bundled with PHP. It is designed to be used for development only. It is not recommended to use it in a production environment.

```
.
└── marketplace
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── README.md
    └── public
        └── index.php
    
# go to the public/ folder
# and start the web server with this command
php -S localhost:9876

```
